# Python-PSQL

This is a personal project that im coding using basic PostgreSQL and Python, with the module Tkinter. Most of the code is based on an existing project from [Fazt Code](https://github.com/FaztWeb/python-tkinter-postgres). I will be adding different features but most of the code relays on his work. After all, this was made for self-taught purposes.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK7LqjxBbh0&t=1967s&ab_channel=FaztCode) is the video i watched for learning.

### How it works?

You can connect to your PSQL Database via the command line when you run the code. After that is done, The program displays a GUI where you can add a student to your database. This is because it was firstly thought for a students' database.
